<h1>Three Delicious Foods</h1>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
	<div class="content">
		<section class="heading heading1">Chicken</section>
  		Chicken is delicious. I enjoy lemon chicken with a side of broccoli. I season it with a little salt and pepper. This is dummy text, feel free to continue reading if you'd like! I typically cook it at high temperature; I think it tastes better that way. 
  	</div>

  	<div class="content">
   		<section class="heading heading2">Steak</section>
   		Steak is delicious. I enjoy grilling steak on a summer night. Season it with a good amount of salt and pepper to bring out the flavor. Again, this is more dummy text. I enjoy a side of spinach with steak.

  	<div class="content">
  		<section class="heading heading3">Sushi</section>
  		Sushi is delicious. I enjoy going out to dinner with friends; we often go out to eat sushi. Sushi must be eaten with chopsticks, forks are not allowed. More dummy text here! I like to have a small bowl of miso soup before sushi.
